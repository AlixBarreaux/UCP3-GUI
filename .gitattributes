# NOTE:
# The source contains another part about LFS, but while it reduces the size of the repo somewhat,
# Github offers it only with limits and charges for it after 1GB.
# Strangely, using binary does not include any restriction, despite having to keep
# a copy of the data for every change. So we handle the pictures as binary for now.
